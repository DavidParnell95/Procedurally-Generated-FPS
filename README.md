# Procedurally Generated FPS
## Assignment for Game-Engines 1
This project is an Assignment for TU Dublin's 4th year Game Engines 1 Module using procedural generation. 

## Project Summary
This project uses procedural generation to create a 3D maze that
the player navigates in first person similar to the 1992 game Wolfenstein 3-D and  1993 game DOOM 
created by ID software.
Enemines will randomly spawn throughout the maze that will try to 
kill the player as they navigate the maze. 
Using a weapons the player spawns with player must fight their way through the maze. 
Weapons will include raycast weapons and projectile weapons. 

## Development Process
Using an array of online tutorials and the unity documentation I created my own implementation
of procedural dungeon generation. On top of this I implemented random enemy spawns and both 
raycast and projectile shooting.

## Proudest Component
The maze generation was the trickiest component to implement. It took the longest amount of time
to implement and even required a restructure of the project. Eventually when an implementation was 
created that successfully generated a random maze every time the game was launched.

# Inspiriation
Having played video games since the age of 4, I've always been drawn to FPS, RPG and platformer games. In particular old school shooters such as  Duke Nukem 3d (1996) by 3D Reams and DOOM (1993) and Wolfenstein 3D(1992) by ID Software gained huge popularity and hooked me into gaming as a child. Recently a resurgence of these "Retro Shooters" has occured since the release of DOOM (2016) by ID Software and DUSK by new blood interactive. This resurgence pulled me back into the confined, maze like levels of old school shooters. The only thing is, once youve beaten a level there's little reason to return. This made me think: "what if the levels were never the same". As a result I want to create a retro style first-person shooter with procedurally generated levels, making the potential for new experiences almost limitless
