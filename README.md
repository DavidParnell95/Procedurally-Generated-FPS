# Procedurally Generated FPS
## Assignment for Game-Engines 1
Assignment for TU Dublin's 4th year Game Engines 1 Module. 

## Project Summary
This project uses procedural generation to create a maze that
the player navigates in first person similar to the 1992 game Wolfenstein 3-D and  1993 game DOOM 
created by ID software.

kill the player as they navigate the maze.

player must fight their way through the maze.
