# Procedurally Generated FPS
## Assignment for Game-Engines 1
This project is an Assignment for TU Dublin's 4th year Game Engines 1 Module using procedural generation.  

## Project Summary
This project uses procedural generation to create a 3D maze that
the player navigates in first person similar to the 1992 game Wolfenstein 3-D and  1993 game DOOM 
created by ID software.
Enemines will randomly spawn throughout the maze that will try to 
kill the player as they navigate the maze. 
Using a weapon the player spawns with, and randomly spawned weapons found throughout the maze the 
player must fight their way through the maze. 
Weapons will include raycast weapons and projectile weapons. 
When the players health hits 0, the game will reset.
